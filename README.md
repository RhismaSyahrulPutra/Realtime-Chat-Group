<h1 align="center">REALTIME GROUP CHAT</h1>

### üì° Background

<p align="justify">Instant communication has become a primary necessity in today's digital era. Real-time messaging applications allow users to interact directly without delay, whether in personal, educational, or collaborative work contexts. Through this project, I aim to explore how real-time communication systems work within a simple web-based application.</p>

### üéØ Project Objective

<p align="justify">The goal of this mini project is to build a group chat application that allows users to join specific chat rooms and exchange messages in real-time. This project also serves as a learning medium for implementing real-time features and managing dynamic user interactions.</p>

## How To Use

### Cloning The Repository

To get a local copy of this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.** For example:

    cd your-repository
    ```

    Replace `your-repository` with the actual name of the repository you cloned.

You now have a local copy of the project and can start working on it!
